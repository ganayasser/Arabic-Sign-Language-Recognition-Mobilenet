# Arabic-Sign-Language-Recognition-Mobilenet
###This project utilizes the MobileNet model to recognize and classify Arabic Sign Language (ARSL) from images.
## üìÅ About Dataset

- **Arabic_Alphabets_Sign_Language_Dataset/**: Contains images of Arabic sign language alphabets for classification.
- **mobilenet_weights/**: Directory with pre-trained MobileNet weights used for model building.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and Jupyter installed. Check your Python version with:
```bash
python --version
```
To install Jupyter, run: 
```bash
pip install notebook
```
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ganayasser/Arabic-Sign-Language-Recognition-Mobilenet.git
cd Arabic-Sign-Language-Recognition-Mobilenet
```
3. Install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üìù Running the Notebook
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
 ```bash
  jupyter notebook
```
2. Open the notebook file Arabic-Sign-Language-Recognition-Mobilenet.ipynb from the Jupyter interface.
3. Run the cells to preprocess data, build, train, and evaluate the MobileNet model for Arabic Sign Language recognition.
